    "Scientists' reliance on computing and software skills increases daily, but often a student in the physical sciences may only take one (or sometimes zero!) programming courses. As a result, these programming skills are often self-taught and can sometimes result in poorly-built and/or incorrect software. One way to remedy this would be to insist that scientists get an extra degree in computer science or software engineering. This however is unfeasible for a variety of reasonables.\n",

However, $4/3$ has a decimal component and thus must be represented as type `float`, meaning that Python has requested space to store the decimal part of our answer as well. We can thus solve our problem by writing 4 and 3 with type `float`; in general, it is good practice to always represent your numbers with type `float` if you think there is a chance you will suffer from roundoff error  (or truncation error), the mistakes that result in representing numbers with incorrect type."

The main difference between dictionaries and lists is that dictionaries use a key-value pair rather than a numerical index to locate specific entries. But why would we want to use a dictionary instead of a list? Say we have a car and we want to specify several different properties of the car: its make, model, color, year. We could of course put this information in a list."
