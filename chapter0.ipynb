    "Often when we think of scientists conducting an experiment, we think of laboratories filled with beakers and whirring machines. However, especially in physics, these laboratories are often replaced by computers, whether they are simple desktop machines or some of the world's largest supercomputing clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists' reliance on computing and software skills increases daily, but often a student in the physical sciences may only take one (or sometimes zero!) programming courses. As a result, these programming skills are often self-taught and can sometimes result in poorly-built and/or incorrect software. One way to remedy this would be to insist that scientists get an extra degree in computer science or software engineering. This however is unfeasible for a variety of reasonables.\n",

    "One alternative is to give students exposure to software development at an earlier point in their education. This gives up-and-coming scientists a chance to hone their coding skills for a longer period of time and will help to avoid many of <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101013/pdf/467775a.pdf\">the pitfalls that scientific codes have recently been subject to.</a>\n",

    "This textbook seeks to give an introduction to software development through a series of motivating physical examples using the Python language. Specifically, we will be using the IPython notebook which will allow us to mix code with equations and explanations. Our first chapter will provide a (very!) brief introduction to the Python language and all of the other additional tools we need to work through the following physical examples."
