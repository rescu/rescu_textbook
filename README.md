Lesson plans for pedagogical approaches to scientific computing
## Ch. 0-Introduction
### Introduction to Python/Programming

+ variables
+ arithmetic
+ boolean logic-and,or
+ conditional statements-if,elif,else
+ iteration-for and while loops
+ functions and reusable code; usefulness of functions; classes if theres time
+ good programming practice
+ much of this is best taught by example

### Plotting-Introduction to Matplotlib

+ how to handle figures/axes-setting figure options
+ good plotting practices
+ using colors, labels, legends
+ plotting in higher dimensions-contour plots, surface plots if there's time
+ scaling variables
+ saving figures versus printing to screen

### Using Numpy and SciPy

+ vectors, arrays, matrices
+ emphasize `linspace`,`arange`,etc.

### LaTeX and Markdown

+ using IPython notebook effectively
+ Markdown syntax
+ LaTeX syntax-formatting equations, usefulness outside of IPython environment
+ differences between Python, IPython notebook-cell evaluation versus standard scripting environment
